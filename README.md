# sobolSensitivity

This folder contains different methods for performing sensitivity analysis, through Sobol Indices. The method that currently exists in this folder is through generalized polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) using sparse grid quadrature (smolyak). It has been shown that this method outperforms sampling methods in terms of convergence [1]
